## Initialize YARA-L Theme

If the YARA-L theme does not automatically apply, you can manually set it by following these steps:

1. Open Command Palette: Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) to open the Command Palette.

2. Access Theme Settings: Type "Color Theme" in the Command Palette and select "Preferences: Color Theme" from the list of options that appear.

3. Select YARA-L: Scroll through the list of available themes until you find "YARA-L Theme", then select it. If you have many themes installed, you can start typing "YARA-L Theme" to filter the list.

The YARA-L theme should now be applied to your Visual Studio Code editor.
