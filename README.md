## Initialize Yara-L Theme

If the Yara-LTheme does not automatically apply, you can manually set it by following these steps:

1. Open Command Palette: Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) to open the Command Palette.

2. Access Theme Settings: Type Color Theme in the Command Palette and select Preferences: Color Theme from the list of options that appear.

3. Select Yara-LTheme: Scroll through the list of available themes until you find Yara-LTheme, then select it. If you have many themes installed, you can start typing Yara-LTheme to filter the list.

The Yara-LTheme should now be applied to your Visual Studio Code editor.
